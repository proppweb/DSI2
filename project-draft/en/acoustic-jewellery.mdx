Living in space in a confined environment involves the total lack of natural elements-such as air, water, light, temperature, humidity-that are fundamental to our biorhythms, while instead the instrumentation of the International Space Station (ISS) produces a constant and annoying background noise that in the long run generates stress.

Other problems stem from a sense of loneliness, due to the distance from loved ones on Earth, and paradoxically from the need to isolate oneself due to the lack of privacy caused by having to share very small open spaces with other people during all activities, such as conducting scientific experiments, but also preparing meals and sleeping.

Acoustic Jewellery are earbuds that can be worn like jewelry to balance astronauts' stress levels. They reproduce natural Earth sounds-such as that of rain and water flowing in streams, the hiss of the wind, the rustle of leaves as we walk through a forest-and reduce the frequency of background noise through a hexagonal texture to enable quieter communication with family members on the ground.

On the soft surface of the earbuds in contact with the ear are three small spheres that correspond to specific reflexology points that with gentle pressure help promote relaxation.
