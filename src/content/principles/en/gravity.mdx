Human physiology, posture, movements, are influenced by gravity. In Space, the changing geometry of gravity draws a cognitive, physical, spatial displacement. Vital fluids pour into the upper part of the body, giving rise to the “puffy face” phenomenon. Limbs become thinner, the trunk swells, muscles lose tone and bones decalcify.

The lack of gravity affects the mechanisms of proprioception. The body experiences a different postural adaptation than on Earth. The calibration of forces to grasp an object must be remodelled and dampened: gestures are soft, movements slowed down and more conscious, more directed towards action, more studied because they are unprecedented and to be observed.

Space Design has the task of redesigning new habitats and equipment that can be used as countermeasures to the negative effects of reduced gravity, seeing it as a potential advantage to innovate and not as a limitation to be overcome.
