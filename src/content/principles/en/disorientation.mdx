Designing for Space calls into question our entire terrestrial experience by forcing us to confront the disorientation and spatial transfiguration resulting from the perception of two realities: the inner, confined environment of the orbiting space station and the immensity of Space, from which it is possible to observe the Earth from the outside.
In microgravity, spatial references change completely: there is no longer a high and a low, a right and a left, except by convention.

The sensation of weightlessness, floating and spinning without fixed points of reference alter both the perception of oneself and of one's surroundings. Terrestrial cognitive models undergo a complete upheaval, generating new kinesthesias and modes of interaction.

Space Design is able to reshape this transition by designing innovative environments and objects to support human beings in the process of adaptation to the different physiological and cognitive conditions experienced in Space.
