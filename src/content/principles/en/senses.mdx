Our organism is designed to adapt, as far as possible, to all conditions. When it perceives a change in the environment, it adapts by modifying its behaviour. In Space, confinement and reduced gravity amplify visual and sound perceptions making lights and noises more intense and annoying. The different pressure on the retina causes colours to appear less saturated, taste and smell to lose intensity, while touch develops more, and consequently the choice of materials and surfaces becomes more important.

Equally fundamental are the quality of proxemic relationships and the semiotics of objects, capable of evoking earthly memories and transforming an environment devoid of natural stimuli into a more intense and reassuring experience.

The avant-garde of Space Design is to design “sensorial space environments” to rebalance the psycho-physical state through the strategic use of colours, materials and technologies, integrating ergonomic and functional aspects with emotional ones to establish new living standards that go beyond survival, offering greater comfort and well-being.
