Living in confined environment for several months means a total absence of natural stimuli, which alters the circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness, causing depression and stress. The effects of enforced isolation are compounded by homesickness and the lack of privacy that comes from living in the same small space as other people.

Designing for Space means not only creating habitats to protect against hostile external conditions, but also going beyond functional aspects to consider the physiological, sensory and emotional aspects that are altered in confined spaces by the lack of natural stimuli.

The aim is to develop an advanced concept of “biosphere” to improve the quality of life and the relationship between humans and nature beyond Earth.

Space Design can use different countermeasures to the effects of forced isolation, for example light, by modifying its colour and intensity to reproduce the natural day and night cycle and rebalance circadian rhythms, or materials, to make the environment warmer and more comfortable, or flexible furniture, to modify spaces and create common or  privacy areas.
