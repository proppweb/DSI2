In Space, objects behave differently due to the gravity, creating new uses and gestures that give rise to novel shapes and behaviour. This process, which cannot be tested on Earth because the absence of gravity cannot be replicated, leads Space Design to the creation of objects that derive from Earthly functions but evolve in relation to the environment.
Use & Gesture Design (UGD) is a space methodology created by Annalisa Dominoni and Benedetto Quaquaro for designing environments and products in reduced gravity. It requires a great capacity for “foresight of use” to imagine how an object will behave in Space, how it will interact with the environment and the crew, how it will be used by astronauts and what kind of performance it will offer.

Designing for Space represents an extraordinary opportunity to generate innovation, bridging science, technology and beauty. It is not only a matter of solving functional and practical problems, of finding the best technology, but also of attaching equal importance to the aesthetic and perceptive qualities of the environment and objects, creating a new space visual identity.
