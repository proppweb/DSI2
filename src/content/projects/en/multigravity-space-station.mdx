One of the most fascinating aspects of Space Design concerns interplanetary mobility. The Moon and Mars represent the next destinations for extraterrestrial settlements. In the future, manned space missions could go beyond the boundaries of our solar system, exploring planets with completely different characteristics and gravity. To sustain long-duration space travel spaceships will have to be equipped with advanced artificial gravity systems designed to ensure the physical and psychological well-being of the crew, responding specifically to the needs of terrestrial human physiology.

An integrated gravity management system will be crucial to ensure the success of future interplanetary missions. Space travellers moving from Earth’s gravity to microgravity in Space, and then to Mars, will have to adapt, once they reach the Red Planet, to a reduced gravity of about one third of that of Earth.

Designing a space station capable of supporting transitions from one planet to another, even multiple ones within the space of a day, is an ambitious and highly relevant challenge. Multigravity Space Station is designed to reproduce Earth’s artificial gravity during space travel and to gradually adapt to the gravity conditions of the destination planet. This approach allows the crew to prepare physically and psychologically for the new environmental conditions, facilitating gravitational adaptation.
