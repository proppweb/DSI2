In microgravity, astronauts' movements are derived from a system of pulling and pushing the body by using all the limbs. In order to move from one point to another on the International Space Station (ISS), a hand or foot must be placed on a supporting surface, while to remain stationary in a given position and perform any activity, you need to anchor yourself.

Grip2-Bound2 are two arm-like prosthetic devices - the first designed to facilitate movement and the second to provide stability - to assist astronauts and parastronauts in routine and non-routine operations inside and outside the ISS.

Grip2 extends the range of motion through a telescopic mechanism. It can be attached to the forearm with adjustable Velcro straps or held loosely for easier movement, especially in the middle of the habitable modules when it is difficult to reach the walls to give yourself a push. The end section has a three-lobed shape that allows for different hooking and pushing possibilities. 

Bound2 is a two-cord system that can be stretched around the diameter of a space station module by means of a double spring-loaded spool on which a semi-elastic rope is wound. Each retractable rubber cord is connected to two anchor points that use Gecko Grip technology to attach to the walls of the ISS, and the central spring holds the cord in tension, creating a reference line to which the astronaut latches to maintain position. Lightness and speed are the two main requirements that make the Grip2-Bound2 system effective and efficient.
