As in a normal home, the International Space Station requires regular maintenance and cleaning, especially in a confined environment. It is unimaginable how many particles are generated by skin flakes, food particles or fragments of other materials floating in microgravity and creeping into very small spaces.

The Stardust system consists of a wearable corset, a suction unit and five prosthetic accessories integrated into a pair of gloves that can adapt to different shapes and surfaces. The corset is made of hypoallergenic material reinforced by composite elements to which a small suction unit and a series of housings for the accessories are attached. The suction unit is connected to the gloves by two textile channels sewn along the sleeves. The gloves incorporate the controls for the suction unit and a directional green light to help detect dirt in less visible crevices. At the end of the fingers, the five prosthetic accessories can be attached and interchanged, allowing great flexibility of movement to reach the most difficult to clean areas and surfaces.

Rather than holding a vacuum cleaner, as is currently the case on board the ISS, the astronaut moves his arms using the accessories integrated into the gloves as prosthetic extensions.
