In the almost complete absence of gravity, it is impossible to maintain a stable position. On the International Space Station, astronauts use mechanical anchors to reduce uncontrolled movement, as the weightless body tends to shift and float in space, increasing the time it takes to perform even normal daily activities.

The main objective of Space Design is to improve crew comfort and performance through new objects designed specifically for confined and reduced gravity environments.

The observation of body behaviour and gestures in Space is a fundamental part of the analysis and research work carried out in parallel with the development of prototypes in a kind of circular design, where the application of the Use & Gesture Design (UGD) methodology is of great help in imagining the astronauts’ relationships between environment and tools.

Orbit is a portable stabiliser positioned at navel level that, thanks to a joystick, allows the user to remain stationary in a chosen position, but also to direct and control movement along the main axes. The design is based on an in-depth engineering study which has led to the use of a reaction wheel mechanism, currently used for satellite stabilisation, which allows posture to be controlled by acting on the three axes of orientation. Inside, an automatic system detects any change in the astronaut’s position through a system of gyroscopic sensors.
