The confined environment reduces natural stimuli and the possibility of finding privacy and isolation from the crew's group life. The long-duration missions of the near future will have to take this need into account by developing sensory habitats designs capable of rebalancing the astronauts' biological cycles.

Bubble Wave represents an innovative concept of private space for astronauts: a comfortable refuge in which to relax, spend leisure time and sleep. A tool allows you to adjust the environmental characteristics, customising colours and lighting according to your preferences.

The upholstery is made of a soft fabric, capable of interacting with OLED and soft robotics technologies, allowing it to expand up to six times its initial length. This responsive material offers astronauts an intuitive interaction, activated by simple presses on the surface.

Il cocoon combines functional aspects, such as storage for personal items or worktops for the PC, with emotional elements, including textured surfaces and lighting designed to balance circadian rhythms. This integration contributes to improving the operational performance and psychophysical well-being of astronauts.
