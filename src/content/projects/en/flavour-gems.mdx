In Space, on the International Space Station microgravity causes various alterations in the physiological, psychological, and sensory systems of human beings, who continue to function as if they were counteracting gravity. The attenuation of taste and smell, and consequently a lack of appetite, is a disturbance experienced by many astronauts.

The role of Space Design is to become an effective countermeasure to the discomfort caused by living in confined and reduced gravity environments through designs that can re-establish both biological and perceptual balance and improve comfort conditions on board. Greater well-being implies better performance and a higher probability of a successful space mission.

Flavour Gems is a texture set consisting of nine instruments that differ in colour and surface treatment to stimulate the taste buds in different areas of the tongue. Regular use of these tools counteracts anosmia and ageusia by rebalancing sensory perceptions to encourage proper nutrition.
