The sense of loneliness that crew members feel when they are away from home and family for many months is one of the biggest problems of living in Space in a confined environment due to the extreme conditions. Although nostalgia is currently reduced by the possibility of video calls, the physical absence cannot be compensated.

Space Design goes beyond functional aspects to consider the physiological and emotional aspects that have a great influence on our behaviour. The multidisciplinary approach allows the integration of disciplines as diverse as mechatronics and robotics to create disruptive innovations.

Send Sense provides the sensation of a hug thanks to two soft twin robots that allow two people, one on Earth and one in space, to communicate by remotely transmitting the sensation of movement and touch generated by the shifting of internal fluids controlled by a CPU. They consist of a rigid core for charging and transmission and a soft part and can be worn on the hand or around the arm.
