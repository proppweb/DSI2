The different gravity present on the Moon, 1/6th that of the Earth, makes our bodies much lighter, favouring walking “by leaps and bounds”. 

Space Running takes advantage of this condition to allow astronauts to proceed at a high speed while exploring the area. In addition to a lighter configuration of the extra-vehicular suit, achieved by superimposing advanced technological layers, Space Running relies on three fundamental components: two carbon-fibre prosthetic elements integrated into the sole of the boots - inspired by the “cheetah flex-foot” foils used on Earth by several Paralympic athletes, which provide thrust through the spring effect enabling the astronaut to make great leaps forward - and a gyroscope in the backpack complete with a pair of sensors to ensure stability.

The sensor pair, connected to the HUD information system interfaced with the helmet's visor, detects obstacles and depressions on the lunar surface, increasing safety during movements.

Looking ahead, and imagining future scenarios in which space tourism will favour the design of entertainment experiences on the Moon as well, a playful extension of the system is envisaged to allow tourists to experience an immersive moonwalk in which, thanks to augmented reality, obstacles on the terrain can be transformed into challenges to be overcome and scores to be obtained as in a video game.
