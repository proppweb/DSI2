Light in Space is essential to reproduce the natural cycle of sleep and wakefulness, and to restore circadian rhythms disturbed by the lack of natural light. But there is also what could be called the “architecture of light”, which defines different areas and atmospheres in the same open environment, depending on the activities carried out by the crew, acting on the temperature and shape of light thanks to light screens that divide spaces or light areas that define work or relaxation spaces.

Noctiluca is a luminous drone equipped with proximity and position sensors and stabilising gyroscopes that allow it to float and move inside the International Space Station. Thanks to AI, it can detect and follow the astronauts during their daily activities in orbit by emitting two types of light: a diffuse ambient light directed upwards and a conical light directed downwards that embraces the astronauts, creating a private personal space around them within a single collective space and changing their perception of their surroundings.
