The Sensory Space Station project, commissioned by Thales Alenia Space, celebrates Made in Italy and introduces, for the first time, an entire module dedicated to the entertainment of astronauts with innovative solutions to balance the lack of natural stimuli in confined environments and respond to the need for privacy. 

Thinking of a future in which space will be populated by numerous spaceships, the aim was to make the Sensory Space Station recognisable from the outside. The shape evokes a ring with windows set like precious stones, symbolising the beauty and excellence of Design Spaziale Italiano.

Inside, great attention has been paid to perceptual and sensorial aspects, such as the quality and colour of light that can change following the natural day/night cycle to balance the circadian rhythms and to create different atmospheres according to the various activities of the astronauts. The strategic use of colours, materials and textures enhances the visual and tactile qualities of the surfaces to create a warmer and more welcoming atmosphere than the aluminium that covers the interior of the International Space Station. To reduce the noise of on-board instruments, the interior of the modules and part of the furnishings are covered with sound-absorbing textiles. Racks are replaced by cylindrical containers that can rotate on rails to allow flexible configurations, such as chaise longue for relaxation, while movable textile partitions provide privacy.

This project is a virtuous example of how Design for Space can promote the transfer of knowledge and technology between the space industry and terrestrial Made in Italy companies: Caimi Snowsound, involved in developing innovative acoustic solutions, now produces the acoustic panels for Thales Alenia Space's Cygnus modules.
