Designing for Space requires a great capacity for foresight of use to imagine how an object will behave in space, how it will be used and how it will relate to its environment which is characterised by different conditions, such as confinement and reduced gravity, that are not part of our terrestrial experience.

Space Design, through the habitats and objects it creates, can have a decisive influence on the form and performance of new artefacts, generating new gestures and behaviours, but also, as in this case, taking inspiration from everyday life that aims to make us feel “at home” in Space.

Star Fruit is an orange-shaped comfort food made of edible packaging containing fruit powder. With the addition of water, it expands to take the defined shape of the fruit without producing any waste.

The gesture of eating the fruit segments compensates for the lack of natural food in the room with the tactile and visual experience of remembering the taste and smell.
