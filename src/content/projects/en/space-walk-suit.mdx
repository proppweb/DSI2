The Space Walk Suit is designed to allow space tourists to move around in Space by maximising the mobility of the suit and enhancing helmet visibility, while a drone, closely linked to the suit and acting as a secondary life-support system, stays with us at all times to provide assistance in case of need, and at the end of the walk “hugs” us and brings us back to the spacecraft.

Designed with safety, comfort and ease of movement in mind, the integrated suit is made up of a combination of rigid elements and soft fabrics that form the solid shell of the torso to which the helmet, backpack and drone are attached. The helmet - equipped with a HUD that provides information on vital parameters, suit status and what is in the field of view - is very spacious compared to existing helmets and offers a unique panoramic experience.

The drone has an integrated life support system that can provide oxygen and power in the event of an emergency or suit malfunction. It can normally float and follow the tourist at a short distance during the space walk, or work in conjunction to integrate with the front of the suit, forming a unified system. Two handles on its upper part allow it to be held, so that it can be used as a personal assistant, with micro-propellers to facilitate movement in the vacuum. Another possible use of the assistant drone is to support all external maintenance operations, during which it can float at a short distance from the astronaut and act as a convenient “tool trolley”. Possible terrestrial spin-offs of the project are very interesting. It could be used in the underwater environment to monitor divers and provide assistance during deep dives.
