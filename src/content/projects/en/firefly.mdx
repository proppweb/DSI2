The psychological aspects of astronauts will become increasingly important in future interplanetary missions, and the design of sensory environments will be essential to ensure the well-being and efficiency of the crew. The poetic use of technology is the main inspiration for the whole project to create atmospheres that allow the astronaut to feel “at home'” Firefly introduces the metaphor of a swarm of fireflies on a summer night, transforming a system of luminous micro-drones into a living, pulsating entity that follows and assists the astronaut by illuminating the area around him, while at the same time creating a strong visual and symbolic impact throughout the spacecraft environment.

The drones can vary the amplitude of the light beam by changing the inclination of their small wings, while flying in groups they can delimit a pre-defined area maintaining their position through AI coordinated micro-sensors.

The system for controlling and regulating the light intensity can easily create a pulsating effect of light that animates the space and refers to the idea of nature as a living organism. In another configuration, the glowworms can merge to create more powerful light sources when more light intensity is required. The charging stations are designed to transform into luminous objects when in use, resembling illuminated windows.

Adding symbolic value to indispensable components such as light sources, by transforming them into reminders of the natural world and our everyday lives, is a very effective solution for restoring a serene state of mind even in Space.
