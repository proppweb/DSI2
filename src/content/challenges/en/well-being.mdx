Inhabiting Space for longer and longer periods involves creating an environment in which people are well and in which they can feel comfortable. In which they can experience the feeling of being at home.

Space Design creates well-being by increasing this perception. It does this through sensory habitats, furnishings and equipment that are comfortable and safe to use, objects that can communicate their function, experiences that can generate positive emotions.
