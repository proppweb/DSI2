In Space the lack of gravity alters many physical and cognitive parameters of which we have no experience. Earthly cognitive “pre-sets” skip and new kinesthesias and gestures are created. The Use & Gesture Design (UGD) methodology requires a great deal of “pre-vision” of space experience. How will a new object we design for Space behave? How will it be used by astronauts? And what relationships might it create with them and their surroundings? What kind of performance will it be able to offer?
