Throwing a kilo into Space costs a lot of money because it requires energy. Designing lighter building systems, as well as reducing the number of elements, becomes critical.

Space Design seeks to reduce the weight of equipment and objects in various ways: chooses inflatable habitable structures, uses less material while taking advantage of microgravity,manufactures a substantial portion of components on-site from indigenous materials.
