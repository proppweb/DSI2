Microgravity makes even normal daily activities more difficult and complex.Performing tasks and procedures, as well as moving around, takes more time.

Space Design designs habitats and equipment to facilitate performance.

Designing activities and tools to perform them in Space, is the key to improving astronaut efficiency, and consequently mission success.
