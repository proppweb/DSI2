In Space, the confined environment amplifies visual and tactile perceptions of objects and surfaces, lights and noises become more annoying, taste and smell lose intensity. Creating “sensory space environments” means defining new, more comfortable living standards, beyond survival, in which tactile and visual sensations, the semiotics of objects, as well as the quality of proxemic relationships, which bring us back to earthly memory, are important to make experiences more intense and reassuring.
