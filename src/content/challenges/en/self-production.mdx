Upcoming interplanetary human missions look to the very real possibility of inhabiting other planets. Space stations, lunar and Martian bases will have to be self-sufficient from Earth's supply.

Space Design aims to transform extraterrestrial habitats into “living organisms” capable of self-generating resources and fully reusing waste. Self-generation becomes particularly attractive because it involves both biological and inert materials.
